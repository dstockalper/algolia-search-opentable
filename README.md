# algolia-search-opentable

This project is a ReactJS app that uses Algoliaâ€™s search-as-you-type JS Helper on OpenTable data: https://dstockalper.github.io/algolia-search-opentable/

A data manipulation and import script called import_json.js can be run with node and will combine restaurants_info.csv & restaurants_list.json into restaurants_combined_data.json. This combined file can be dropped into the Algolia dashboard to index the restaurant data.
